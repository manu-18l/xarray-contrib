# xarray-simlab: xarray extension for computer model simulations.

xarray-simlab is a Python library that provides both a framework for creating
computational models from re-usable components and a
[xarray](http://xarray.pydata.org) extension for setting and running
simulations using the xarray's `Dataset` structure.
