# Fastscape: Fast LEM in Python

**Warning: this package is currently under heavy development (no release yet).**

Fastscape is an open-source Python package that provides, through a basic but
powerful API / UI, a fast and well-tested implementation of a small set of
efficient algorithms for Landscape Evolution Modeling (LEM).

It also provides:

- A lightweight framework for easy development, combinination and
  run of new LEMs (a few built-in models are available in this package).

- A small set of "topographic tools" useful for processing model outputs
  or Digital Elevation Models (DEMs).

- Extensions to the [xarray](http://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/) package that
  allow easy handling of space/time dimensions and exploration of model
  parameter spaces.
